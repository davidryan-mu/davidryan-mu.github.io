                                    <p align="justify">Mood tracking is a technique in positive psychology that includes the tracking, recording, and
                                        analysis of a person’s mood. It can be used personally or to support a counselling programme
                                        with a professional psychotherapist. This project addresses the facilitation of this process, in a manner that would allow a user to easily begin
                                        practicing this technique by means of the design and development of a cross-platform mobile
                                        application.</p>

										<h2 class="major">User Research</h2>
									    <p align="justify">A UI/UX problem begins with the user. Designing with a lacking understanding of the user
                                        requirements is equivalent to shooting in the dark. User research should be the fuel to an analysis
                                        of a problem such as the one being dealt with in this project. Following the research into the topic of mood and how to model it, the techniques deployed to ensure user-centred design and develop an
                                        understanding of user requirements included user stories and user personas.

										<h2 class="major">Prototyping</h2>
									    <p align="justify">Following the period of user reseach, low-fidelity wireframes were sketched down on paper. The sketches provided a way of
                                        brainstorming ideas and a reference point for the lower-level creation of high-fidelity wireframes
                                        that get closer to the final design and showcase more detail.

                                            interactable wireframes to give a sense of what a functioning prototype would look and feel like.

										<h2 class="major">User Testing</h2>
									    <p align="justify">Given that the approach to this UI/UX project was of a very user-centred nature, it was logical to
                                            utilise user testing as a testing method. As such, the focus group was quite small. A group of 13
                                            UI/UX/IxD students volunteered to join the tests. The data collected was of a mostly qualitative
                                            nature and was gathered by means of a survey to be completed after attempting a set number of
                                            tasks that would test each function of the application.

										<h2 class="major">Future Work</h2>
									    <p align="justify">Future work would include building custom widgets to give the app
                                            a more unique look and feel, closer to what was envisioned in the design stage.

                                        <p align="justify">The reflection stage of mood tracking could be improved by further developing the Statistics and
                                            Calendar screens of the app. Input from a professional psychotherapist could be insightful to
                                            provide more useful data visualization.
                                        </p>
                                        <p align="justify">A notification system could also
                                            be included in future work, giving the user the ability to set reminders to log their mood so that
                                            they do not fall out of the habit.</p>

                                        <p align="justify">The contributions by testers provided valuable insights into what could be done as part of future
                                            work to further improve the app. This showed the benefit of the user testing approach as ideas
                                            outside of the developer’s mindset can come to fruition. The results show that this app has the foundations for being a useful assistant in a user’s self-management of mood and that further work with a concentrated focus on eliminating existing bugs
                                            and refining UI/UX is required to see it to that goal.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">Given that this project was an introduction to mobile application development, the processes of
                                            user research, following UI/UX best practices, seeing through the development of an app through
                                            coding and user testing, were all immensely educational. Having not worked on a project of this
                                            scale and thoroughness before, it was greatly rewarding to work alongside testers and receive
                                            feedback on a project that received so much time and effort. </p>
