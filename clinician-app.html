									<p>Working as a team, myself and my teammates designed a mobile app for personal diabetes management. <br />
									We then designed a web-based clinician app for communicating with patients using the mobile app.</p>

									<p>We conducted our own research on personal diabetes management and created our own low-fidelity mockups. We then reflected on each others designs and came together to design the mobile app as a team. <br /><br />
									Individually, we designed both a low and high-fidelity mockup for a web based clinician app based on the mobile app we created.</p>

										<p>BetesBuddy is an app designed with the goal of taking care of all the irritating parts of personal diabetes management. The app reminds a user to input data such as glucose levels and carbohydrate intake so that they will have a log to help them get an idea of how they are managing their diabetes. To make this easier to review, BetesBuddy produces graphs based on this data. These statistics and graphs will give users a better idea of how they are coping with their diabetes on a longer term.</p>

										<p>A web-based application for clinicians who provide care for those living with diabetes. It provides a service that allows them to quickly provide feedback to patients based on data they send to the clinician. It also provides the ability to manage several clients easily and it assists in keeping medical records of patients. The designed application greatly improves the speed of conversation between clinicians and patients and saves them time by allowing a clinician to provide feedback which may not call for an appointment.</p>
